__Eukariotic Cells__

  + __Nucleus__
    + Nuclear pores
      + Allow things to move in and out of the nucleus
    + Nuclear envelope
      + Outer nuclear membrane
      + Inner nuclear membrane
    + Makes ribosomes
  + __Rough endoplasmic reticulum__
    + Attached to the nucleus
    + Studded with ribosomes
  + __Smooth endoplasmic reticulum__
    + Attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum
    + Does not have ribosomes
  + __Ribosomes__
    + Read DNA and create proteins
    + Made of ribosomal RNA
    + Not membrane bound
    + Two subunits
      + Large subunit
      + Small subunit
    + Located:
      + On the rough ER
      + Freefloating in cytoplasm
      + In mitochondria

  + Proteins made on the ribosomes in the rough ER are released into the interior of the rough ER
  + Proteins travel through to the smooth ER, get packaged into vescicles and transported to the golgi apparatus
  + Proteins get packaged by the golgi apparatus for exocytosis

  + __Golgi Apparatus__
    + Protein packaging facility
    + Creates lysosomes
  + __Lysosomes__
    + Very simple organelle
    + Vacuole full of strong destructive enzymes
    + Used to digest food particles
    + Used to break down damaged organelles
  + __Mitochondria__
    + Dual membrane
      + Smooth outer membrane
      + Faceted inner membrane
    + Convert energy from one form to another
    + Most of the breakdown of glucose happens inside the mitochondria
      + Breaks glucose down into ~36 ATP
    + Have their own DNA
    + Have thier own ribosomes
    + Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited
  + __Chloroplasts__
    + Photosynthesize
  + __Cytoskeleton__
    + Not membrane bound
    + Like scaffolding
    + Very dynamic - constantly being broken down and reconstructed
    + Motor proteins can move materials in the cell along the cytoskeleton
