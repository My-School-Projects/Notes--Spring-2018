### Chemistry

**Element:** A fundamental type of matter with unique chemical properties that connot be broken down (by ordinary chemical means) into substances with other chemical properties

**Atom:** The smallest component of an element that maintains the chemical properties of that element

**Subatomic Paritcles:**
  - Protons
    - Positive charge
    - Atomic mass: 1
    - Location: nucleus
  - Neutron
    - No charge
    - Atomic mass: 1
    - Location: nucleus
  - Electron
    - Negative charge
    - Atommic mass: ~0
    - Location: shells/orbitals

**Atomic number:**
  - Represents the number of protons
  - Identity of an atom is _always_ determined by the number of protons
  - Number of neutrons can vary

**Atomic mass:**
  - weighted average based on the commonality of each isotope

**Isotope:** The configuration of how many neutrons an atom has

**Unstable Isotopes** (aka Radio Isotopes)
  - Radioactive
  - Emit gama rays when they decay
  - Have a half life (the time it takes for the weight of a sample to decrease by half)

_**Fun fact**: because water with tritium and deuterium (heavy water) is heavier than normal water, heavy water forms droplets first and so heavy rain falls earlier than normal water_

**Ion:** Charged atom - different number of electrons than protons

**Molecule:** Two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds

**Compound:** Two or more different types of atoms held together by chemical (not necessarily covalent) bonds

**Ionic Bonds:** 2 oppositely charged ions held close to one another by attraction of opposite charges
  - Electrostatic attraction

**Covalent Bond:** 2 posotively chaged particles held together by sharing one or more electrons
  - Polar Covalent Bond: Electrons shared unequally
  - Non-Polar Covalent Bond: Electrons shared equally

  - Polar covalent bonds are sort of like ionic bonds
  - Polar bonds are the reason for surface tension in water
  - High thermal capacity of water also due to polar bonds (before you can heat water you have to break the polar attractions)
  - Polar covalent bonds can sometimes devolve into ions

**Hydrogen Bond:** Weak bonds between polar molecules
