Biology Notes 2/5
-----------------

__Monomers__
  + Carbohydrates: monosaccharides (sugars)
  + Proteins: amino acids
  + Nucleic acids: nucleic acids

__Nucleic Acids__

  + __5 elements__
    + Carbon
    + Hydrogen
    + Oxygen
    + Nitrogen
    + Phosphorous

  + __DNA:__ Deoxyribose
  + __RNA:__ Ribose

  + __Nitrogenous Bases__
    + __DNA:__
      + Adenine
      + Thymine
      + Cytocine
      + Guanine
    + __RNA__
      + Adenine
      + Uracil
      + Cytocine
      + Guanine
    + __Pairs:__
      + Adenine <--> (Thymine / Uracil)
      + Guanine <--> Cytosine

  + __ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate__
    + 3 components:
      + Adenine
      + Ribose
      + 3 phosphate groups
    + Phosphate groups have high energy bonds, which is used as energy storage for a cell
    + Breaks down into __ADP (adenosine diphosphate)__
      + Loses a phosphate group, releasing energy
    + Aerobic rhespiration results in constructing an ATP out of an ADP and a phosphate group

### Cells

__All cells have 4 things in common:__
  + __Plasma Membrane__
    + Made up of a phospholipid bilayer
      + Cholestorol binds adjacent phospholipids and makes the membrane stronger
      + Proteins float in the membrane
        + __Channels__, which specific materials can move through
        + __Transporters__, which require energy to move materials through
        + __Enzymes__, which work like transporters and channels but work differently
        + __Identity markers__, which identify different cell types
        + __Receptors__, which are used to recieve messages from other places in the body, such as testosterone or insulin
  + __Region where DNA is found__
    + Nucleus in the case of eukariotic cells

  + __Ribosomes__

  + __Cytoplasm__
    + Gooey stuff inside the cell

__2 Basic Kinds of Cells__
  + __Prokaryotic__
    + Simpler, smaller
    + No membrane-bound organelles
    + Bacteria, Archaea
  + __Eukaryotic__
    + Larger, more complex
    + Many membrane-bound organelles
    + Animals, Plants, Fungi, and others

__Diffusion__
  + Movement of _individual_ molecules is random
  + Net movement is from areas of high conentration to areas of low concentration
  + __Passive Transport:__ No added energy - _high -> low concentration_
    + __Simple Diffusion:__
      + Molecules "sneak" through phospholipids in the membrane
      + Most commonly small, non-polar moleucles
        + O2 and CO2
    + __Facilitated Diffusion:__
      + Molecules diffuse (still randomly) through protein channels in the membrane
  + __Active Transport:__ Pump materials across the membrane - _low -> high concentration_
    + Molecules are pumped through the membrane by transporters
      + Requires ATP
  + __Osmosis:__ Diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane

__Cytosis:__
  + __Endocytosis:__ Pinch off a section of cell membrane called a vacuole, bringing in a large particle or quantity of fluid
  + __Exocytosis:__ Golgi apparatus creates a vacuole around the particle or fluid to be expelled, and the process is reversed
