Biology Notes: Wed 3/21
-----------------------

__Restriction Enzyme (or Endonuclease)__
   + Cuts the DNA at a specific sequence (which will be a palindrome)
   + Cut DNA leaves "sticky ends"
      + Exposed single strand left open will want to rebind

__Eco R1__

    GAATTC
    CTTAAG

    G       AATTC
    CTTAA       G

__Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)__
   + Amplify (copy) a strand of DNA rapidly
   + Thermocycler
      + Tiny DNA sample
      + Pre-designed primers
      + DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase)
         + Found in bacteria from Yellowstone (withstands high temperatures)
      + Large supply of nucleotides
