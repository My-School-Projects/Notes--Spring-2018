pH
  - pH is a measure of the concentration of H+ in a solution
  - Water dissociates into H+ and OH- (hydroxide)
  - Strong acids dissociate completely, releasing lots of H+ into the solution
  - Weak acids dissociate less, releasing fewer H+ into the solution

Monomers = a single unit
Polymers = many units (multiple monomers)

Dehydration Synthesis
  - Loss of water
  - Joining monomers together

Hydrolysis
  - Addition of water
  - Breaking polymers apart

Carbohydrates
  - 3 Elements
    * Carbon
    * Hydrogen
    * Oxygen
  - Types:
    * Sugar (monosacharide) - short term energy storage
    * Starch (polysacharide) - longer term energy storage
    * Cellulose - structural
    # Glycogen is a starch made from chains of glucose
    * Made up of repeating sugars called saccharides
      - Monosaccharides - one sacharide (glucose, fructose)
      - Disaccharide - two sacharides (sucrose -> splits into glucose and fructose using sucrase)
      - Oligosaccharides - few saccharides
      - Polysaccharides - many saccharides
        * Chitin forms the exoskeleton of arthorpods

Lipids
  - 3 Elements
    * Carbon
    * Hydrogen
    * Oxygen
    # But fewer oxygen atoms than carbohydrates
  - Non-polar (hydrophobic)
  - Types:
    * Triglycerides
      - Saturated fatty acids
        * Saturated with hydrogen atoms
        * No double bonds
        * Solid at room temperature
        # Animal fats have more saturated fatty acids
      - Non-saturated fatty acids
        * Space for more hydrogen atoms
        * Liquid at room temperature
        # Plant fats have more unsaturated fatty acids
      - Trans fatty acid
        * Hydrogenated oil
        * Behave like saturated fatty acids even though they are non-saturated (solid at room temperature)
      ~ Glycerol
      ~ Triglyceride-Saturated
    * Phospholipid
      - Has one section that is polar
        * Fatty acid tails - hydrophobic
        * Phosphate head - hydrophilic
      - When surrounded by water, form bilayer (membrane)

Proteins
  - 4 Elements
    * Carbon
    * Hydrogen
    * Oxygen
    * Nitrogen
  - Amino Acids
    - Monomers
    - 20 kinds
  - Enzymes
    * Speed up specific chemical reactions in the cell
    * Build and break down molecules

Nucleic Acids
