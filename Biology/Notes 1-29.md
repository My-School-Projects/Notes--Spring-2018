### Chemistry

__Element:__ A fundamental type of matter with unique chemical properties that connot be broken down (by ordinary chemical means) into substances with other chemical properties

__Atom:__ The smallest component of an element that maintains the chemical properties of that element

__Subatomic Paritcles:__
  + Protons
    + Positive charge
    + Atomic mass: 1
    + Location: nucleus
  + Neutron
    + No charge
    + Atomic mass: 1
    + Location: nucleus
  + Electron
    + Negative charge
    + Atommic mass: ~0
    + Location: shells/orbitals

__Atomic number:__
  + Represents the number of protons
  + Identity of an atom is _always_ determined by the number of protons
  + Number of neutrons can vary

__Atomic mass:__
  + weighted average based on the commonality of each isotope

__Isotope:__ The configuration of how many neutrons an atom has

__Unstable Isotopes__ (aka Radio Isotopes)
  + Radioactive
  + Emit gama rays when they decay
  + Have a half life (the time it takes for the weight of a sample to decrease by half)

_**Fun fact:** because water with tritium and deuterium (heavy water) is heavier than normal water, heavy water forms droplets first and so heavy rain falls earlier than normal water_

__Ion:__ Charged atom - different number of electrons than protons

__Molecule:__ Two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds

__Compound:__ Two or more different types of atoms held together by chemical (not necessarily covalent) bonds

__Ionic Bonds:__ 2 oppositely charged ions held close to one another by attraction of opposite charges
  + Electrostatic attraction

__Covalent Bond:__ 2 posotively chaged particles held together by sharing one or more electrons
  + Polar Covalent Bond: Electrons shared unequally
  + Non-Polar Covalent Bond: Electrons shared equally

  + Polar covalent bonds are sort of like ionic bonds
  + Polar bonds are the reason for surface tension in water
  + High thermal capacity of water also due to polar bonds (before you can heat water you have to break the polar attractions)
  + Polar covalent bonds can sometimes devolve into ions

__Hydrogen Bond:__ Weak bonds between polar molecules
