Biology Notes: Wed 1/24
-----------------------

__Observational Study:__ Individuals assigned to groups based on preexisting conditions
  --> _Can establish correlation / association only_

__Experimental Study:__ Individuals assigned randomly to treatment and control groups
  --> _Better at showing causation_

__Reasons to do observational studies instead of experimental studies__
  1. As a preliminary study (cheaper, easier)
  2. Not ethical to experiment
  3. Too difficult or expensive to experiment

__P-value:__
  + <=.05 (1/20) is generally considered statistically significant
  + If the possibility of getting results "this different" is less than 1 in 20, then the results are considered statistically significant
