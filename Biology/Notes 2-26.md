Biology Notes: Mon 2/26
-----------------------

__Chromosome__
   + DNA bound with histone proteins
   + Strands are bound to prevent tangling, esp. when dividing

---

### The Cell Cycle

__Phases:__ _see p1_
   + __Interphase:__ Preperation for cell division
   + __Mitosis:__ Dividing genetic material _see DNA Replication_
   + __Cytokinesis:__ Physical splitting the two cells
   + __G1:__ Cellular contents, excluding the chromosomes, are duplicated
   + __S:__ Each of the 46 chromosomes is duplicated by the cell
   + __G2:__ The cell "double checks" the duplicated chromosomes for error, making any needed repairs

__DNA Replication__
   + 5 enzymes (that we care about)
      + Helicase
      + RNA Primase
      + DNA Polymerase
      + RNase H
      + Ligase
   + Helicase splits DNA into two (open) strands
   + SSB coats the strands to prevent unwanted bonding
   + RNA Primase installs an RNA primer (up to 16 nucleotides long) that acts as a starting point that DNA Polymerase can attach to and continue from there
   + RNase H removes the RNA primer
   + DNA Polymerase comes back in and completes the exposed sections (left by the broken down RNA primers)
   + DNA is completed in oposite directions
      + The strand on which DNA Polymerase can continue down without stopping is called the leading strand
      + The strand on which the completion must stop and restart is called the traling strand
   + Ligase comes in and joins the disparate pieces (where the primered sections meet the start of the non-primered sections)

__Stem Cell__
   + A cell capable of producing (by dividing) multiple cell types
   + __Embryonic Stem Cells:__ capable of producing any type of cell
   + As you develop the types of stem cells become more specialized
   + For instance - __Blood Stem Cells:__ capable of producing different types of blood cells
   + __Induced pluripotent stem cells:__ specialized cells that are manipulated to make them pluripotent
      + Avoids ethical problems with embryonic stem cell research
