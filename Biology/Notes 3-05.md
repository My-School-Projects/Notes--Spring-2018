### Meiosis

Two ways to ensure that no two gametes have the same genes
   + I. Independent alignment of chromosomes
   + II. Genetic recombination

Gene: a seciton of DNA that codes for a protein
Allele: different forms of a gene
Genotype: an individual's combination of two alleles for a gene
Phenotype: physical expression of a genotype
Codominance: both alleles are equally dominant (red and white flowers have red and white spotted flowers)
Incomplete Dominance: heterozygotes show an incomplete form of both genes (red and white flowers have pink offspring)
