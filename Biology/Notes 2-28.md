-----------------------

__Cancer__
   + Tumor Suppressor Gene
      + Able to stop cell division from proceeding (checkpoint proteins)
   + DNA Repair Genes
      + Able to fix damaged DNA

   + Telomeres: Inactive DNA that gets lost over time after many many coppies, because DNA Synthase is unable to copy the first several nucleotides in the sequence
   + Telomerase: Adds nucleotides to telomeres, esp. in embryonic and cancer cells, which allows cells to divide indefinitely.

__Genetics__
   + DNA: Genetic material (nucleic acid)
   + Chromosome: DNA complexed with proteins
   + Gene: A section of DNA that codes for a protein
   + Alleles: Different forms of a gene
