-----------------------

__pH:__
  + pH is a measure of the concentration of H+ in a solution
  + Water dissociates into H+ and OH- (hydroxide)
  + Strong acids dissociate completely, releasing lots of H+ into the solution
  + Weak acids dissociate less, releasing fewer H+ into the solution

Monomers = a single unit
Polymers = many units (multiple monomers)

__Dehydration Synthesis__
  + Loss of water
  + Joining monomers together

__Hydrolysis__
  + Addition of water
  + Breaking polymers apart

__Carbohydrates__
  + __3 Elements__
    + Carbon
    + Hydrogen
    + Oxygen
  + __Types:__
    + Sugar (monosacharide) - short term energy storage
    + Starch (polysacharide) - longer term energy storage
    + Cellulose - structural
    + _Glycogen is a starch made from chains of glucose_
    + Made up of repeating sugars called saccharides
      + Monosaccharides - one sacharide (glucose, fructose)
      + Disaccharide - two sacharides (sucrose -> splits into glucose and fructose using sucrase)
      + Oligosaccharides - few saccharides
      + Polysaccharides - many saccharides
        + Chitin forms the exoskeleton of arthorpods

__Lipids__
  + __3 Elements__
    + Carbon
    + Hydrogen
    + Oxygen
    + _But fewer oxygen atoms than carbohydrates_
  + __Non-polar (hydrophobic)__
  + __Types:__
    + __Triglycerides__
      + __Saturated fatty acids__
        + Saturated with hydrogen atoms
        + No double bonds
        + Solid at room temperature
        + _Animal fats have more saturated fatty acids_
      + __Non-saturated fatty acids__
        + Space for more hydrogen atoms
        + Liquid at room temperature
        + _Plant fats have more unsaturated fatty acids_
      + __Trans fatty acid__
        + Hydrogenated oil
        + Behave like saturated fatty acids even though they are non-saturated (solid at room temperature)
      + _Glycerol_
      + _Triglyceride-Saturated_
    + __Phospholipid__
      + Has one section that is polar
        + Fatty acid tails - hydrophobic
        + Phosphate head - hydrophilic
      + When surrounded by water, form bilayer (membrane)

__Proteins__
  + __4 Elements__
    + Carbon
    + Hydrogen
    + Oxygen
    + Nitrogen
  + __Amino Acids__
    + Monomers
    + 20 kinds
  + __Enzymes__
    + Speed up specific chemical reactions in the cell
    + Build and break down molecules

__Nucleic Acids__
