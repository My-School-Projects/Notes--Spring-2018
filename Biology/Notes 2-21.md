__Cellular Respiration__
   + Main goal is to produce ATP that the cell can use

   __1st Step: Glycolysis__
      + Takes place in the cytoplasm, _not_ the mitochondria
      + Does not require oxygen
      + Requires 2 ATP to start the reaction
      + Produces 4 ATP
      + --> Net gain of 2 ATP
      + Product: 2 Pyruvate

   __2nd Step: Krebs Cycle, or Citric Acid Cycle__
      + Produces 2 ATP

   __3rd Step: Electron Transport Chain__
      + Produces (about) 34 ATP
      + Electrons are transported along the inner membrane of the mitochondria
      + Movement of electrons produces energy which is used to push H+ to the outer compartment (area outside of the inner membrane)
      + ATP Synthase are special channels that allow H+ back inside the inner membrane, but collect energy and create ATP
