## Biology Notes: Wed 1/24

**Observational Study:** Individuals assigned to groups based on preexisting conditions
  --> _Can establish correlation / association only_

**Experimental Study:** Individuals assigned randomly to treatment and control groups
  --> _Better at showing causation_

**Reasons to do observational studies instead of experimental studies**
  1. As a preliminary study (cheaper, easier)
  2. Not ethical to experiment
  3. Too difficult or expensive to experiment

**P-value:**
  - <=.05 (1/20) is generally considered statistically significant
  - If the possibility of getting results "this different" is less than 1 in 20, then the results are considered statistically significant
