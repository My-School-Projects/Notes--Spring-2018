Biology Notes: Wed 1/24

Observational Study: Individuals assigned to groups based on preexisting conditions
  --> Can establish correlation / association only

Experimental Study: Individuals assigned randomly to treatment and control groups
  --> Better at showing causation

Reasons to do observational studies instead of experimental studies
  1. As a preliminary study (cheaper, easier)
  2. Not ethical to experiment
  3. Too difficult or expensive to experiment

P-value:
  - <=.05 (1/20) is generally considered statistically significant
  - If the possibility of getting results "this different" is less than 1 in 20, then the results are considered statistically significant
