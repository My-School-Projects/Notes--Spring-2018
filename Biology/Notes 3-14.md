Biology Notes: Wed 3/14
-----------------------

Genes are made up of
   + Introns
   + Exons
   + _--> introns are stripped out of mRNA leaving only exons_

Transcription
   + mRNA made from DNA (gene)
   + _--> in the nucleus_
Translation
   + mRNA is "read off" or decoded to make a protein
   + _--> in the cytoplasm on a ribosome_

Organization of genes
   + Promoter - sequence of nucleotides that marks the start of a gene
   + Terminator - sequence of nucleotides that marks the end of a gene

Creation of mRNA
   + RNA polymerase attaches to promoter
   + Moves along the strand, copying until it reaches a terminator
   + _--> to prevent activation of a gene, attach a suppressor protein to the promoter sequence_

RNA Processing or Splicing
   + Add the methylated cap
      + Cap helps mRNA get through the nuclear pores
   + Add the poly A tail
      + A long strand of repeated A (adenine) nucleotides
   + Cut out the introns and join the exons
      + This is done by _spliceosomes_

Transfer RNA
   + Small unit of RNA that codes for a single anticodon
   + Attaches on one side to mRNA, and an amino acid on the other
