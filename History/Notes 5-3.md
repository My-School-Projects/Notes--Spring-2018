   + The "Great Society" was a series of reforms
      + Head start - public preschool for poor families
      + Job Corp - job training programs for young poor people
      + Medicare - medical care for people over 65
   + Roughly a quarter of the American population lived below the poverty line in 1962
   + JFK was firmly committed to the doctrine of containment
   + He believed in the Domino Theory, that if one country falls to communism, then the country next to it turns communist, and the next one, and so on
   + He believed that if Vietnam turned to communism, then the whole of East Asia would turn communist
   + He is assassinated in 1963, and LBJ becomes president
   + Building The Great Society was his life's ambition, and his main focus
   + To push these bills through congress will require a great deal of political capital, and he needs to remain in good standing with the American people
   + He needs to appear tough on communism to stay in office
   + _Vietminh__ - North Vietnamese Communists
   + _Vietcong_ - South Vietnamese Communists

__II. 1964-1968: Escalation__

   + __A. America's Faith in Military Superiority__
      + The US could not conceive of the possibility that they could lose to a guerrilla insurgency
      + Their strategy was simply to drop more bombs

   + __B. America Responds to The Attack on Pleiku__
      + LBJ ordered reprisal attacks on North Vietnam
         + Ordered more than 100 jets to drop bombs on North Vietnam
      + North Vietnamese make counter offensives of their own
      + This begins the cycle of escalation

   + __C. Operation Rolling Thunder__
      + Two basic goals
         + To destroy the supply lines that kept the North Vietnamese troops equipped with guns and ammo etc.
            + The Ho Chi Minh Trail was a network of roads and trails through the jungles of Vietnam and its surrounding countries used as supply routes
         + To destroy the morale of the North Vietnamese government and the soldiers fighting for them
            + By making such a display of American military force that they would give up and surrender
      + Begins in 1965 and lasts until 1968
      + Americans would drop hundreds of bombs every day
      + _Operation Ranch Hand_ was a campaign to destroy the jungle cover
      + US sprayed a very powerful herbicide called Agent Orange
         + Agent Orange was highly toxic
         + One of its active ingredients was a known carcinogen
         + Vietnam vets have higher than average mortality
      + Operation rolling thunder failed to accomplish its objectives
         + With regards to the Ho Chi Minh trail, they would simply hack a new trail
         + When people lost friends and family to US bombings, it only strengthened their resolve

__III. 1968: The Tet Offensive__
   + Launched diversionary attacks near the western border
      + Pulled American troops away from Saigon
   + Tet holiday was normally a cease fire
   + 70,000 Vietnamese attack 100 different cities including Saigon
   + The Tet Offensive did not succeed
      + They lost a lot of soldiers
   + It also succeeded
      + US had did not expect it
      + Exposed how poor American military intelligence was in Vietnam
      + Changed public opinion in America, because for the first time, people saw that we weren't winning the war
         + People start to think that the government is lying to them, because they had been led to believe that we were winning the war
      + Walter Cronkite - news anchor for CBS - considered the most trusted man in America - says he doesn't think they're gonna win the war
      + LBJ says "If I've lost Walter, I've lost the country"

__IV. Withdrawal From Vietnam__
   + LBJ was so beaten up by the Vietnam war that he decided to run for re-election
   + Richard Nixon - republican candidate - was sensitive to public opinion and campaigned on pulling out of Vietnam
   + He was elected, and made good on that promise
   + Vietnamization - pull American troops out and put the burden onto the Vietnamese army
   + 540,000 troops in Vietnam in 1949
   + 50,000 troops in 1963
   + The communists capture Saigon, Vietnam is united under communist rule, and the war is over
