### An Unsettled West: _The Johnson County War_

__I. Indroduction: A Violent Land?__
  + The idea of the wild west is deeply engrained in our culture because of Hollywood
  + We think of it as a lawless and violent land
  + There was, in fact, quite a bit of violence in the American West
  + The West in the late 19th centry was not much more violent than the rest of America at the time
  + Homicide rate in "rough and tumble" cattle towns in the American West similar to or lower than that of many modern American cities
  + Far more people died just making a living in a dangerous job than at the hands of another person
  + The violence that we do see in the late 19th century is typically a product of social and economic conflict

__II. Big Dreams on the High Plains__
  + Cattle ranchers were the first to move onto the high plains after the Native Americans were relocated
    + Rich grasses for their cattle to eat
    + Some were very wealthy and powerful people
    + Horace Curzon Plunkett
      + Son of an Irish land baron
    + Hubert Teschemacher
      + Graduated Harvard
      + Trust fund kid
      + Had half a million dollars in credit
    + The open range was not fenced off, it was common space

__III. "Rustlers," Ranchers and The Wyoming Stock Grower's Association__
  + In the 1880's the price of cattle bottomed out
    + Bankrupted a lot of people
    + People who were not bankrupted were the big rich ranchers

  + __A. The W.S.G.A__
    + Trade organization representing the interest of large cattle ranchers
    + Helped the cattle ranchers market their cattle
    + Would negotiate with railroads for freight discounts
    + In the 1880's they got concerned with too many people getting involved in the cattle business
      + Prices would go down
      + Overgrazing could cause a dust bowl
    + Farmers and others would also have some cattle on the open range, and the WSGA got concerned about that too

  + __B. The Issue of "Maverick" Calves__
    + Maverick calves were calves roaming the range with no brand
    + Smalltime ranchers would try to grow their herd by looking for maverick calves on the open range
    + This was considered fair play
    + WSGA didn't like this custom

  + __C. The Blacklist and The Maverick Law__
    + WSGA has friends in the territorial legislature
    + 1883: WSGA passes a law (applied to its members) so that any cow hand who had their own herd could not work for the WSGA
      + Forced cow hands to chose between keeping their herds and losing their jobs, or selling their herds and keeping their jobs.
    + 1884: Territorial legislature gives the WSGA control of all of the cattle herds on the open range'
      + Anyone who was not a member of the WSGA who was wrangling their own cattle was automatically considered a rustler
      + All maverick calves on the open range belonged to the WSGA
      + You could buy calves on public auction, but before you could bid you had to put up a bond of $3,000

__IV. Violence on The Open Range__
  + WSGA didn't always get its way in the courts
    + Lots of small ranchers got busted and put on trial
    + Juries would be made up of peers who despise the WSGA
  + WSGA took matters into their own hands
    + Frustrated by their lack of success in the courts
    + Hired a team of armed killers to harass and kill those that they suspect of being rustlers
    + 1889: WSGA lynches James Averell and Ella Watson aka "Cattle Kate"
      + Both had filed homestead claims on land owned by WSGA members
      + Watson would curse and spit at WSGA members when she saw them
      + No one testified in the murder of Averell and Watson
    + WSGA draws up a hit list with about 70 names on it
    + April 1892: WSGA hired about 50 gunmen to kill the people on the list
      + Killers staked out the cabin of Nate Champion, a suspected rustler, opened fire on him and his companions as the sun was coming up
      + One was killed immediately, Nate Champion was shot as he was running away
    + Small farmers were furious about this vigilantism
      + Go after the armed killers
      + For 3 days they were shooting at each other all over Johnson County Wyoming
      + Only one more person got killed, and he died by shooting himself in the groin
      + Hired thugs were outnumbered by the locals and they had to leave town
    + WSGA loses its influence
