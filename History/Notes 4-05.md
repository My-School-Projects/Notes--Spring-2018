### Harry Truman and the Doctrine of Containment: _The Cold War_

__I. Introduction: What was the Cold War?__
   + A War between two very different economic systems

Capitalism               | Communism
-------------------------|------------------------------
Private Property         | Public (state owned) property
Profit (upward mobility) | Equality
Individual gain          | Collective well-being

   + A communist market is a market that the US cannot export to
   + US fears that communism will spread, closing market opportunities
   + Soviet Union fears that the brutal inequality of the US will spread
   + Both want to have allies in the rest of the world
   + Both systems start to behave in the same way when it comes to global politics

__II. Background: The Bolshevik "Threat"__

   + __A. US Opposes Bolshevik Revolution, 1917__
      + Czarist government is destabilized by its failure in WWI
      + Bolshevik communists take over in 1917
      + Communists believe that it is the destiny of all communist nations to fall and be replaced by communism
      + US sent troops in to kill the Bolshevik revolution
      + Russian civil war 1918-1927
         + Reds: Bolshevik communism
         + Whites: US, European powers, czarist russians
      + Bolsheviks manage to hang on, and learn that the capitalists are literally out to kill them and destroy communism

   + __B. Stalin's Dictatorship__
      + Stalin was an OG Bolshevik
      + Comes to preside over the system after Lenin dies
      + 5-year plans: very very ambitious plans for industrial development wherein the state commands the people to industrialize
         + People who failed to meet their quotas were punished
         + Millions of people starved
         + People who protested were killed
      + Soviet Union looks truly terrifying to anyone who believes in basic freedoms

__III. Wartime Cooperation, Wartime Tension__
   + US and Soviets were allies in World War II
   + FDR made a promise to Stalin in 1942 that the US would help the Soviet Union by launching a major attack on the western front to take pressure off of the Soviet Union
   + Doesn't deliver on his promies until 1944 at D-Day
   + Creates Soviet distrust toward the US

__IV. Postawar Problems: Stalin Wants a "Sphere of Influence"__
   + Stalin moves quickly to install pro-soviet leaders throughout central and eastern Europe
   + Soviet troups were well into central and eastern Europe when the war ends
   + Stalin wants a buffer zone to make sure Russia doesn't get invaded again
   + He called it a Sphere of influence
   + Pro-capitalism leaders were killed or exiled by the Soviet military, ensuring communist governments in those countries

__V. Truman Takes Charge; Relations Deteriorate__
   + FDR died in April of 1945 and was replaced by Truman, who did not have FDR's charm
   + Truman was kept in the dark about some of the agreements that FDR and Stalin had made
   + Truman sometimes spoke crudely to Soviet officials
   + Trumans attitude only contributed to the existing distrust

__VI. The Doctrine of Containment__
   + Truman was not a subtle thinker and did not distinguish between a fascist regime and a communist regime, and viewed both as pure evil
   + George Kennan, a very bright and influential foreign policy adviser, develops the Doctrine of Containment, which says that the US must do everything in its power to stop the spread of communism, and it is the only power that can
   + He furthermore argued that if communism could be contained, it would eventually fall
   + Soviets would prey on impoverished nations
   + Kennan argued that the US needed to give financial and military assistance to fight against communist expansion
   + Doctrine of Containment continued for the next 45 years
   + Beginnings of the Vietnam war, and others
