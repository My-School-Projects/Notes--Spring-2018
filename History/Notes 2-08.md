### Industrial Order and Disorder, Part One: Homestead

__I. Introduction: The Future of Unions in Industrial America__
   + People who worked in factories in the 1880's worked very long hours, maybe 12-14 hours per day, 7 days a week, with very few days off
   + Factory workers tried to form unions to improve working conditions
   + 1892: Strike at the Homestead Steel Mill
      + On either side were:
         + One of the nation's strongest industrial unions, The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AAISW)
         + Andrew Carnegie, who was very rich and powerful
      + Stakes are high: will unions have a place in the new industrial economy?
      + Working conditions:
         + Workers got one day off per year (4th of July)
         + Difficult and dangerous working environment
         + Low wages
         + No prospects for advancement
   + For the next 40 years organized labor will be weak because of what happens at the Homestead Mill

__II. Pittsburgh: Steel Capital of America__
   + Pittsburgh was located near all of the resources needed to make steel
      + Not far from the great lakes region, where there are massive deposits of iron ore
      + Near the Alleghany mountains, which is very rich in coal
      + Sits on top of a major seam of bituminous coal
      + Sits near the juncture of 3 major navigable rivers
         + Ohio
         + Alleghany
         + Monangahela
      + Plenty of railroads as well
      + Destination for a lot of immigrants
         + Plenty of workers for steel mills

__III. Andrew Carnegie: The King of Steel__

   + __A. Life and Background__
      + His life overlapped the growth of the american steel industry
      + At one point in his life owned more steel capacity than the entire nation of England
      + Was also the richest man in the world for part of his life
      + Didn't start off rich
         + His life is often cited as a rags to riches tale
      + Born in Scottland to a working class family
      + His father was an artisanal weaver - one of the best
         + Respectable standard of living
         + Displaced by the industrial revolution
      + Carnegie watched his father lose his standing and slip into poverty
      + Carnegie's family leaves Scottland and goes to Pittsburgh (borrowed money for passage)
      + Carnegie finds a job at a textile mill earning $1.20/week
      + Very intelligent, and knew that he needed to have a skill to succeed
      + Learns the telegraph
      + Becomes the personal secretary and telegrapher to Thomas Scott
         + Thomas Scott is a very wealthy and powerful business man
         + Superintendent president of the Pennsilvania Railroad
         + Scott becomes like a surrogate father to Carnegie
      + Carnegie learns all about big business from his job
      + Carnegie makes a lot of money by helping Scott skirt the law
         + By today's standard he would have been a multi-millionaire

   + __B. 1873: Carnegie Enters the Steel Business__
      + Had learned a lot about the steel business through his association with Thomas Scott
      + Accquired as many steel factories as he could
      + Basic philosophy: keep production costs as low as possible, and profits will take care of themselves
      + Ran a lean operation
         + Kept wages as low as he possibly could - including salaried managers
      + Takeovers:
         + Would buy stock in his competitors
         + Would get their financial reports
         + Would go to the board and explain how he could beat the current owners, and convince them to sell to him
      + Keeping costs low pitted him constantly against the unions

   + __C. 1883: Carnegie Purchases the Homestead Mill__
      + Homestead came online in 1879 as state of the art steel mill
         + Bit into Carnegie's market share
      + Managers of the Homestead Mill tried to drive out the AAISW in 1883
         + Locked out the workers until they renounced their union membership and agreed to a lower wage
         + Mill had many contracts to fulfill at this time
         + Started falling behind on thier quotas causing problems for their buyers
         + They had to let the mill workers back in
      + Managers decided to sell Homestead at a steep discount

__IV. The Homestead Strike of 1892__
   + Carnegie negotiates with the union but is always looking for an opportunity to bust them
   + In 1892 the country started slipping into a fairly serious depression
      + Demand for steel slowed down
   + This allows Carnegie to shut out the workers again
      + Told union leaders that they had to cut their wages
      + Union did not agree to Carnegie's terms
      + Negotiations dragged on for months
      + Carnegie realizes they aren't going to accept his conditions
      + Goes on an extended fishing trip where he cannot be communicated with
         + Leaves negotiations to his second in command, Henry Clay Frick
         + Frick is ruthless
            + Frick had made a fortune in coal and coke production
            + Worked very hard to bust the unions in the mining industry
            + Knows every dirty trick in the book
            + Not above hiring trained killers
         + Carnegie instructs Frick to do whatever he has to to break the union
      + Frick gives the union manegers an ultimatum in June of 1892
      + Meanwhile he starts building a fence around the mill, preparing for a lockout
         + Wants to shut out union workers and let non-union workers in
         + Turns to the Pinkerton Detective Agency to provide an armed escort for the non union workers
      + July 6, workers notice barges moving 300 armed Pinkerton guards into the mill
      + Workers started shooting at the Pinkertons
      + Pinkertons surrendered, and got the shit beat out of them on the way out
      + Frick calls upon the governor to send in the Pennsilvania National Guard
      + National Guard provided escort for the non-union workers, and work resumed - the union was broken
      + Carnegie wins, the union was busted, but shots had been fired and many people lost their jobs
         + Many AAISW workers got their names on blacklists, throwing them into poverty
      + This was a PR disaster for Carnegie
      + Carnegie cared a lot about his public image and blamed Frick
      + Carnegie and Frick become enemies
      + Years later they get in a fist fight and Frick says "I'll see you in hell, where we're both going."
