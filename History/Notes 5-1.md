### America's Longest War, Part One: Vietnam, 1945-1964

__I. Introduction: Decolonization and the Cold War__

   + Colonies decided that this was the time to fight for independence, starting with India
   + These newly independent nations had the choice of alignment with the democratic west or the communist east
   + Vietnam fights for its independence after WWII
   + They free themselves from France in 1945 and the US steps in to try to keep them from becoming communist
   + Films about Vietnam

      + Apocalypse Now
      + Good Morning Vietnam

__II. The United States, France and Vietnam, 1945-1964__

   + __A. Ho Chi Minh and the Dream of Vietnamese Independence__
      + Many french moved to Vietnam and set up plantations
      + The people of Vietnam set up underground resistance to the French
      + Ho Chi Minh presented a petition for Vietnamese Independence in 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference
      + Woodrow Wilson talked about national self-determination
         + Those who saw themselves as an independent nation should have an independent nation
         + He thought of this as only for white people
      + Disappointed at being rejected at the Paris Peace Conference
      + He joined the Indochinese Communist Party, who were aligned with Vietnamese Independence
      + Ho Chi Minh should be understood first as a nationalist, and only secondarily as a communist
      + With France occupied by the Nazis, the Japanese imperialists move into Vietnam
      + Ho Chi Minh fights against the Japanese, with the support of the US
      + When Japan surrendered in August of 1945 following the dropping of the atomic bombs, Ho Chi Minh believed that Vietnam was then independent
      + September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh declares Vietnam's independence and celebrations ensue
      + The French government pressured the US into assisting France with holding onto Vietnam
         + France will join NATO if the US helps them in Vietnam

   + __B. The French Defeat at Dien Bien Phu__
      + US supplies billions of dollars to France
      + French set up a Vietnamese puppet governor, Bao Dai
      + Bao Dai supported big business at the expense of the poor
      + Because the peasants despised Bao Dai, they joined the Indochinese Communist Party in ever increasing numbers
      + With the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the French agree to pull out of Vietnam
      + This left only the US to defend against the rise of communism

   + __C. The Geneva Accords__
      + In July of 1954, diplomats from China, Vietnam, France and the US meet in Geneva to discuss the future of Vietnam
      + At the meeting they agreed that they would divide Vietnam into two halves at the 17th parallel
         + North Vietnam would be governed by Ho Chi Minh and the communists
         + South Vietnam would be governed by a pro-western governor Ngo Dinh Diem
      + Free elections would be held in 1956
      + US pumps billions of dollars into South Vietnam to make it a shiny example of capitalism, to encourage voters to side with the west

__III. Corruption in South Vietnam: The Diem Regime__
   + No matter how much money the US pumped into the South Vietnamese government, it would never get a democratic government because Diem was a dictator
   + Diem was hopelessly corrupt and appointed many members of his family to high political places
   + He discriminated against Vietnamese buddhists, as he was raised Catholic
   + He ruled South Vietnam with an iron fist, persecuted his political opponents, silenced negative press
   + Diem never held the public election that he was supposed to
   + Opposition to Diem began to grow
      + Buddhist monk sets himself on fire in protest
   + A coup is led against Diem with US support
   + Diem is executed

__IV. LBJ and the Gulf of Tonkin Incident__
   + Before Linden B Johnson was elected, US military involvement in Vietnam was minimal
   + LBJ even promised on the campaign trail not to escalate US involvement in Vietnam
   + LBJ has to look tough in the face of communist expansion, or Barry Goldwater will call him a communist
   + In 1964 an American patrol vessel in the gulf of Tonkin reported that they had been fired at by the communists
   + LBJ asks congress to increase US involvement in Vietnam, and they pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to do just that
