### The Civil Rights Struggle

__I. Introduction__

__II. Before the Brown Decision__

   + __A. The Great Migration__
      + Tens of thousands of African Americans moved out of the South and into northern cities
      + African Americans in the North have access to black run newspapers and magazines
      + African Americans are able to vote in northern cities
      + National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
         + Formed in 1909 by black activists and some white allies
         + Chapters all over the country
         + Raise money, have lawyers - they become a legal and political force
         + Thurgood Marshall was chief legal council for the NAACP in the 50's
            + He navigated the Brown case through the Supreme Court
      + Urban-League also advocates on behalf of African Americans

   + __B. World War Two__
      + African Americans fought in segregated units
      + In factories building war machinery:
         + Black people were paid less than white people
         + Women were paid even less than African Americans
      + A. Phillip Randolph was a long time union leader (African American)
         + Organized a march on Washington July 1st 1941
         + FDR personally asks Randolph to call off the march
            + Offers to pass laws to help with racial discrimination
            + June 5th 1941: FDR issues Executive Order 8802
               + There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defence industries or government on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin
               + Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC): Given the authority to investigate allogations of discrimination
         + The Holocaust shocked people into considering the consequences of racial bigotry

__III. The Road to Brown__
   + The years after WWII were very prosperous for all, including African Americans
      + More African Americans entered school
      + Owned their own homes
      + Went to college (HBCU's)
   + Plessy v Ferguson (1896) - Seperate but equal - was in full effect
      + Seperate schools and colleges
      + Had to ride at the back of the bus
      + Seperate facilities (bathrooms, drinking fountains)
      + Oaths were taken on a seperate black bible
   + African American leaders want to take down the Plessy doctrine
   + Legal Realism: a school of legal thought that holds that more often than not, laws are structured to oppress people rather than protect them
   + 1941: Thurgood Marshall organized a lawsuit that challenged the Plessy doctrine
      + He gathered a bunch of cases that challenged racial segregation in public schools
      + Oliver Brown wanted to sue because he had to put his daughter on a bus and send her to a black school rather than send her to the white school which was much closer
      + Earl Warren (Supreme Court Chief Justice) wrote for the majority that the segregation of children in public schools violates the 14th amendment
      + Marshall filed a number of Amicus Curiae briefs from:
         + Veterans groups
         + Jewish groups
      + Marshall also included testimony by Kenneth Clarke
         + Clarke did a study where he had white and black kids play with dolls, and had them identify which dolls were better, prettier, good, bad, and found that black dolls were not preferred, even by black children, showing that black children had internalized a feeling of inferiority
   + "All deliberate speed" ruling allowed schools to integrate as slowly as they liked
   + White people start setting up private academies, especially in the South, where Warren's decision did not stand


__IV. The Montgomery Bus Boycott__
   + Montgomery Alabama 1955: Rosa Parks (officer in NAACP)
   + Parks refused to give up her seat and went to jail for it
   + African Americans boycotted the Montgomery bus system for 380 days
