History Notes: Thu 1/25

African Americans in the "New South"
------------------------------------

I. Intro: The "New South", Rhetoric and Reality
  - Some white southerners felt that slavery had held the south back
  - Henry Grady was one of the biggest champions of the New South
    - He wanted to attract investment, build industry and create jobs
    - The south had very little industry compared to the north
  - The promised gains in the New South were mostly made by whites
  - Af-ams lost many of the rights they gained during congressional reconstruction
  - Last federal troups pulled out in 1877, leaving af-ams vulnerable to terroristic persecution
  - Radical republicans disappear from politics
  - country loses interest in civil rights for af-ams

II. Economic Disenfranchisement
  - Most af-ams did not own land
  - Most are dependent on white land owners

  A. Segregation in the Workplace
    - Segregation was typical, and often mandated by law
    - Typically af-ams got lower paid, unskilled jobs
    - Segregation prevented inter-race socializing which prevented unions

  B. Sharecropping
    - Most af-ams worked the fields, but wanted more autonomy
    - Family units would work a plot of land but owe between one quarter and one half of the crop yield to the land owner
    - Af-ams often ended up deeper in debt by year end
    - Often required to grow only cotton, so they could not grow their own food
    - Contract might stipulate that the family must buy food and supplies from a specific store (often owned by the land owner, or a friend or relative)
    - Stores would have very high markup and high interest rates
    --> Debt Peonage
    - Af-ams who challenge white store owners for lying about their debt would be silenced by threat (or action) of the klan

III. Political Disenfranchisement
  - Post reconstruciton brought dramatic decrease in black voting power

  A. Voting Laws
    - Literacy tests
    - Grandfather clause
    - Poll taxes
      - Often required to pay months ahead of the election
    - Democrats would move polling places around to prevent black votes
      - For instance, they might move the polling place across a river from a largely black area, and then not run the ferry on voting day
    - Louisiana had well over 100,000 black voters during congressional reconstruction, and only 5,000 within a few decades

  B. Gerrymandering

IV. Education
  - Segregated schools
  - Black schools were not nearly as good
  - White schools got largest share of district money
  - Black schools would close at harvest time
  - "To educate a black man is to spoil a good field hand"

V. The Convict Lease System
  - Democrats passed laws turning petty offenses into major crimes
  - Once (mostly black) indiviudals got busted they were put to work in prison labor
  - Mississippi redefined grand larsony as theft of more than $10, the approximate value of a pig (punishable by five years in prison)
  - Lease system allowed cheap labor from convicts
  - Criminals have no legal rights
  - Convicts had no monetary value
  - Slaves had been protected because of their capitol investment, but there was no need to protect a valueless convict
  - "If one dies, get another"

VI. The Context of Violence
  - Jim Crow was kept in place by the constant threat of klan violence
  - Simply succeeding in their business might make af-ams klan targets
