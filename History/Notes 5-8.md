   + The New Deal Coalition fell apart over the 40's - 60's
   + As the Democratic party begins to advocate for civil rights and environmental reforms, some of these groups would leave for the Republican party

__II. Cracks in The New Deal Coalition__

   + __A. White Southerners and Civil Rights__
      + Harry Truman was a Southern Democrat, but he was deeply shaken by WWII
      + He felt that the US needed to claim the high ground in the Cold War, which meant making progress on civil rights
      + When the democratic party assembled for its national convention in 1948 it included strong advocates for civil rights reform
      + _The Dixiecrat Revolt_ - Strom Thurmond led a walkout of Southern Democrats to protest the party's commitment to civil rights
      + LBJ signed the Civil Rights act of 1964 into law
      + Barry Goldwater was one Republican who opposed the Civil Rights Act
      + Goldwater lost the election, but he had strong support in the South
      + The South went Republican
      + George Wallace was a Southern Democrat who ran for president, on a platform of segregation - the Democratic party would not endorse him so he ran as an independent
         + He does well in the south, and also some white working class districts in the north east

   + __B. Anticommunism__

   + __C. Busing and Affirmative Action__
      + Beginning in the 60's, civil rights legislation is going to demand that institutions be more accessible to women and people of color
      + Busing programs generated a lot of hostility among whites, and there were bitter protests against it
      + Many people object to affirmative action because of reverse discrimination

__III. Reagan's Message__
