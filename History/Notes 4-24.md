### The Struggle in the Fields: César Chávez

__I. Introduction: Delano, California__
  + Delano was a desert
  + Ground water was tapped, and suddenly the land became good farmland
  + Farm owners became very wealthy (mostly white)
  + Farm workers lived in poverty (largely people of color)
  + César Chávez and the United Farm Workers organized a national boycott of the San Joaquin grape industry

__II. Highly Mobile and Politically Vulnerable: Migrant Workers, Braceros and Undocumented Immigrants__
  + Bracero program provided California with thousands of Mexican workers who would work in the US for several months and then return to Mexico
  + Agricultural workers do not have the right to organize unions under the Wagner Act

__III. César Chávez: Life and Background__

  + __A. Early years as a Migrant Worker__
    + César's parents migrated to California and moved around as migrant workers
    + Chávez family saves up enough to buy a small farm in Yuma, where César was born in 1927
    + They are forced to sell the farm in 1938
    + They moved around too frequently for him to get an education (said he went to something like 30 different schools) - 8th grade education
    + The Chávez family often got cheated out of their wages

  + __B. Segregation and Discrimination in the Central Valley__
    + Signs in restaurants would read "No dogs or Mexicans allowed"
    + Chávez was thrown out of a movie theater in Delano when he refused to sit in the "Mexican section"

  + __C. Chávez and the Community Services Organization__
    + Chávez grew up in a family that was very politically active
    + Chávez gets involved in the labor struggle in the 40's
    + In the early 50's he got involved with the CSO
    + The CSO had chapters all across the nation
    + Its main function was to assist the poor
      + Conducted voter registration drives
      + Helped people with immigration papers
      + Helped people file police brutality complaints
      + It was not a labor movement itself

  + __D. Chávez Leaves the CSO: Forms the National Farm Workers' Association__
    + Chávez worked for the CSO for ten years
    + As he rose in the hierarchy he started to feel that the CSO was losing its edge as it started attracting more urban liberals
    + In '62 he submitted a proposal to leadership to organize farmers
      + The CSO says no, and Chávez quits and moves back to Delano
    + For six months Chávez drove around the valley spreading the word about his new union
    + During the days he would work in the fields, and at night he would hold meetings
    + He established credit unions for the workers
    + He would represent workers when they had a disagreement with farmers
    + Delores Huerta was also a part of this
    + In 1964 they start to win wage increases with local growers, but they didn't yet feel comfortable in launching an all-out assault


__IV. 1965: The Delano Strike and Boycott__
  + Chávez and Huerta were planning on launching the strike in 1968 but circumstances forced them to move much sooner
  + In '65 some filipino workers in Coachella succeeded in winning a wage increase
  + The filipino workers went on strike in Delano as well
  + In September of '65, two weeks after the filipinos went on strike, Chávez' union members agree to join with the filipino union members in solidarity
  + A number of prominent clergymen joined the strike, and some even went to jail for it
  + Walter Reuther, the head of the largest union of American auto workers gives the union $10,000 with the promise of $5,000 more each month until they win
  + US senate launches an investigation into working conditions in the valley
  + Chávez appealed to the American public not to buy grapes grown by Delano growers
    + They would follow trucks to the supermarkets and picket the supermarkets, appealing to shoppers not to buy the grapes
  + Warehouses and shippers refused to move grapes in a show of union solidarity
  + One by one, growers begin to negotiate with the union, but a number of them continue to hold out for many years
  + Chávez would increase the concessions for growers who held out longer
  + Chávez starts bringing up new issues, such as pesticide use
    + Farmers in this time period had disproportionate rates of cancer and respiratory problems, and shorter life expectancy
