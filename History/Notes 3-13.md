### "Not Like Us:" The Second Wave of Immigration

__I. Introduction: Strangers in The Land__
   + First immigration restriction law 1882: Chinese Exclusion Act
   + White anglo-saxon protestants (WASPs) started to call for restrictions on certain groups of people in the late 19th century
   + There was a dramatic surge in the number of immigrants coming to the US in the late 19th and early 20th century
   + Many new immigrants are from southern and eastern europe
      + Largely catholic, orthodox or Jewish, not protestant

__II. The Open-Door Era, 1776-1881__

   + __A. Building a Nation, Settling the Frontier__
      + Immigrants that arrive before the civil war make up the "first wave"
         + About 5 million arrived between 1820 and 1860
         + Of those, about 95% came from Northern and Western Europe
         + Most of the immigrants who come in the first wave are seen as culturally simmilar to the WASPs who were in power

   + __B. "Irish Need Not Apply"__
      + Within the first wave, there is one exception: the Irish
      + The Irish were viewed with suspicion and contempt by WASPs
         + Because they were mostly catholic
         + They were colonized by the English, who looked on them with contempt

   + __C. Nativism__
      + A form of ethnic prejudice which asserts that the only true American is a white protestant, preferably Anglo-Saxon or Nordic
      + Apocalypic fears about what will happen when immigrants "take over"
      + Samuel F.B. Morse wrote anti-catholic pamphlets in his spare time
      + Lyman Beecher whipped up so much anti-catholic furvor that he incited an angry mob which went and burned down a convent
      + The republican party was formed in 1850 and was largely nativist
         + Abraham Lincoln was an exception to this

__III. The Era of Restriction, 1882-1924__

   + __A. Nativists Respond to the "Second Wave"__
      + As more immigrants start coming from Southern and Eastern Europe after the civil war, there is an uptick in nativist sentiment
      + The second wave of immigration was much larger than the first
         + First wave: 5 million between 1820 and 1860
         + Second wave: 14 million between 1860 and 1900
      + Many of those who came would move into tightly knit ethnic communities
      + Chain of Migration: people tend to come where their freinds and family have come before

   + __B. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882__
      + Chinese had been coming in before and would continue coming in after the civil war
      + Provided cheap labor on the railroads
      + Chinese Exclusion Act suspended the entry of Chinese for ten years and prohibited all foreign born chinese from acquiring American citizenship

   + __C. The Immigration Act of 1924__
      + Immigration Restriction League was a group that formed in 1894
         + Formed by Harvard men
      + Immigration Act aka National Origins Act
         + Fixed the number of people who could come in from a certain country at 2% of the people already living here from that country
         + Passed in 1924
         + Most recent census data was the 1920 census
         + They used census data from 1890, when there were far fewer immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe
