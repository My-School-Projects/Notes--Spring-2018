### F.D.R and the New Deal

__I. Introduction: The Election of 1932__
   + 1932 Hoover calls out national guard to put down a riot of 15,000 war veterans
   + Congress authorized a bonus for veterans, to come in 1945
   + Depression hits before 1945, veterans want the money immediately
   + This was put to a vote, and there was a lot of support for it in congress but they still voted no
   + Hoover thought it might be the beginning of a revolution
      + Called in federal troops to push out the protesters
      + Tear gas was used, camps were burned
      + There were fatalities including an 11 week old infant who died from tear gas
   + Hoover lost the next election to FDR and his New Deal
   + FDR was not an expert in policy, but he had a gift for picking people who were
   + Also had an uncanny ability to work with people
   + Also had great skill in auration and was the first president to make extensive use of radio

__II. The New Deal: "Bold, Persistent Experimentation"__
   + FDR was very evasive about the details of the New Deal on the campaign trail because he didn't know them
   + His strategy in campaigning was "stay alive until election day"
      + He knew the public would vote for him because they hated Hoover
   + His strategy was to implement a bunch of bold progressive reforms and hope that some of them worked
   + The New Deal gets the federal government much more involved in the social and economic life of the american people

__III. New Deal Reforms__

   + __A. Banking and Finance__
      + FDR's highest priority was to restore confidence in the banking system
      + On his first day in office he issues an executive order closing all of the nation's banks
      + On his second day he encouraged Congress to pass the Emergency Banking Relief Act
         + This act require that banks prove that they had sufficient capitol in order to reopen
         + Those that are short will get an infusion of federal funds
      + Creates the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) which insures your deposits up to (back then) $5,000 (now up to $250,000)
      + Gets on the radio and tells the american people that their money is safer in banks than under their matresses
      + When the banks reopen, more money was deposited than withdrawn

   + __B. Relief and Unemployment__
      + FDR supported a number of public works projects
      + Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
      + Works Progress Administration (WPA)
      + Federal Theater Project
      + Federal Arts Project
      + Federal Writers Project
         + A lot of the material we have on slavery was gathered by the FWP interviewing ex-slaves before they died

   + __C. Subsidies and Price Supports__
      + Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)
         + Offered federal subsidies to produce less, which would help reduce supply and drive the prices up
         + Some would critique this as this raised the price of food just as many people were going hungry

   + __D. Support for Organized Labor__
      + The Wagner Act dramatically strengthened the strength of organized labor by giving workers the right to organize union and prohibiting employers from disrupting union activities
         + National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) who's purpose was to negotiate between unions and managers and supervise union elections

   + __E. Social Security__
      + In the 1920's some larger corporations tried doing something similar called _welfare capitalism,_ but this was privately funded with the intention of discouraging union workers
         + These funds got wiped out in the depression

__IV. Achievement and Limitations of the New Deal__
   + Agricultural workers were categorically exempted from union rules
      + This was deliberate, as southern Democrats did not want black people to gain any power through union rights
   + The depression allowed fascism to come to power in Europe
   + The new deal saved the country from this kind of nasty politics
