### Modern Environmentalism

__I. Introduction: A River on Fire__
   + The Cuyahoga River flows through Ohio
      + Provides power
      + Serves as a sewer
      + So polluted that nothing can live in it
      + Where it runs through Cleveland it can even catch fire
   + 1868: First fire
   + 1969: Time magazine put the burning river on their cover

__II. Rachel Carson and *Silent Spring*__

   + __A. New Concerns in the Postwar Era__
      + Some people felt that we should protect the more beautiful parts of the country from industrialization

   + __B. "Better Living Through Chemistry"__
      + Chemical pesticides were adapted from chemical warfare technology
      + Production of chemical pesticides soars through the roof

   + __C. Rachel Carson Sounds the Alarm__
      + Brilliant scientist, retired to write science books
         + Her books were accessible to the general public and sold well
      + Just as she was becoming popular, scientists were starting to notice side effects of pesticides, namely that they kill all sorts of wildlife
      + In 1958 she was asked to serve as an expert witness in a court case
         + People of long island wanted to stop the spraying of DDT
      + Writes _Silent Spring_ out of the arguments she presented in court
      + 4 major themes:
         + Bioaccumulation (toxins build up in our bodies)
         + People died from long term health problems years after repeated exposure, and these chemicals could trigger cancer
         + Americans were far too casual about their use of these chemicals, which really weren't safe in any use case
         + The bugs that were supposed to be killed by these chemicals often developed a resistance to them

   + __The "Other Road"__
      + People became very concerned about pesticides, and governments conducted studies that agreed with Carson
      + DDT got outlawed (although we still manufacture it for export)
      + Carson concluded Silent Spring with a chapter named "The Other Road"
      + She advocated for "organic" farming

__III. Love Canal__

   + __A. The Making of a Toxic Waste Dump__
      + William Love (entrepreneur) wants to make a canal between upper and lower Niagara to generate hydroelectric power
      + Funding fell out, and we were left with a 60' x 300' pit
      + People started using Love Canal for industrial waste disposal
      + In 1942 it was purchased by the Hooker Chemical Corporation for the purpose of waste disposal
      + By 1952 the canal was full with about 20,000 tons of toxic waste
      + Hooker put a few feet of dirt over all the drums of chemical waste
      + They sold the land to the city of Niagara falls for $1 with the stipulation that the Hooker Chemical Corporation cannot be held responsible for any damages caused by toxic waste
      + Developers built 800 middle class homes, and a public school around the dump site

   + __B. Trouble in Paradise__
      + Lois Gibbs was one of the people who moved there in 1974 with her husband and her 1 year old son named Michael
      + Within a few years her son developed asthma, liver trouble, a urinary tract disorder and epilepsy
      + She then had a daughter who developed similar health issues
      + People would complain of headaches caused by awful smells
      + Kids would play with "blue goo" (exploding dirt) and come home with rashes and burns
      + Heavy rains push drums of toxic waste to the surface and they start to leak
      + People notice substances seeping through the walls of their basements
      + A reporter did an article which told some of the substances that were buried nearby, and she asked her brother in law, who confirmed that those substances could have caused her children's health problems
      + School officials refused to move Gibbs' kids to another school because it would create a precedent (and acknowledge that there was a problem)
      + Officials advised pregnant women to "leave the neighborhood"

   + __C. The Community Organizes__
      + Aug 1980: Jimmy Carter authorized funds to help the residents relocate
      + Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act
         + It allowed the government to sue companies for the cleanup costs, and put that money into _superfunds_ which would be used to clean up the waste

__IV. Conclusion: Environmental Health as a Civil Right__
