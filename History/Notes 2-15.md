### The Growth of American Populism

__I. Introduction: The Meaning of Populism__
   + Politicians are sometimes described as populist
      + Represents themself as "a regular person"
      + Even Donald Trump has been described as populist
      + _This is what populism means today, but it meant something different in the late 19th and early 20th century_
   + Populism was a farmers' movement
      + Farmers felt that they had been abandoned by the two major parties (both the Democratic and Republican establishments)
      + Populists felt that the major parties had become sycophants for industrial powers
      + Largest 3rd party movement in American political history
      + At the peak of their power they had many representatives in the white house
      + 1896 the democrats formed an alliance with the populists and almost won the white house

__II. The Farmers' Complaints__

   + __A. Railroads__
      + Many farmers depended on the railroads to send their crops to market
      + Many felt that the railroads charged far too much money
      + Railroads offered discounts to coal and steel industries but not farmers
      + Railroads had been built with public subsidies
      + Farmers would try to sue the railroad companies but that typically went nowhere

   + __B. Middlemen__
      + Farmers felt that they were charged excessive prices to get the basic materials to farm
      + Farmers often sold their crops through middle men like grain brokers

   + __C. Declining Prices__
      + The late 19th century was a difficult time to be a farmer because average agricultural prices had begun to fall
      + There was a lot of new land and better production techniques, but not enough increase in demand to meet the new supply
         + 1866: 166 million bushels of wheat - $2.06/lb
         + 1900: 599 million bushels of wheat - $0.62/lb

   + __D. The Money Supply__
      + Farmers believed that they were being victimized by a monetary policy that favored business interests over small farmers
      + Strategies regarding circulation:
         + Tight Money Supply - not a lot of money in circulation
            + Low inflation
            + Benefits financial institutions
         + Loose Money Supply - lots of money in circulation
            + High inflation
            + Benefits farmers
      + In the late 19th century the government prefered a tight money supply, and even took money out of circulation
         + 1865: $30 / 1000 people
         + 1900: $27 / 1000 people

   + Farmers felt that it was fundamentally wrong to be oppressed this way
   + They are the backbone of society - without farmers, the cities would fall
   + Farmers believed that if something wasn't done to rescue them, then the country would fall apart

__III. The Farmers Respond__

   + __A. Spreading The Word__
      + All throughout the south and midwest, troubled farmers joined their local farmers' alliance
      + The first farmers' alliance was formed in 1880
      + By 1890 they were spread across the south and midwest
      + Farmers' alliances started publishing their own newspapers, which dramaticized the problems they were experiencing
      + Farmers started organizing grass-roots events
         + They would have giant picnicks with populist rallies at the end
      + Women were very active in this program
         + Mary Lease - told farmers to "raise less corn and more hell"

   + __B. The Populist Program__
      + A coherent platform came out of the populist movement
         + Regulation of the railroads
            + Some even advocated for nationalization of the railroads
         + Creation of the subtreasury
            + An institution designed to protect farmers from the volatility of the free market
            + Subtreasury would offer farmers a low interest loan based on the future valuation of the grain
         + Adoption of a loose money supply
            + By embrasing a bimetallic currency (gold and silver)

__IV. The Election of 1896 and The Decline of Populism__
   + The populists never get a viable presidential candidate
   + They get pretty close in 1896 when William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat running for president, formed an alliance with the populist movement
   + Populists stand behind Bryan in the presidential election, and Bryan chose Tom Watson, a populist Democrat, as his vice president
   + Bryan was an evangelical protestant minister - had an auratorical style that worked well for him while running for president
      + Bryan gave the famous "Cross of Gold" speech
   + His opponent was William McKinley, a Republican
   + McKinley fearmongers among factory workers about inflation
   + Bryan and Watson started saying things that alienating certain consituancies
      + Bryan and watson both came across as anti-catholic
      + Watson refers to the Pope as "Jimmy Cheesy"
      + Watson was very antesimitic
      + Watson was also anti-black
   + Democratic ticket was shot down and the populist movement never made it to the white house
