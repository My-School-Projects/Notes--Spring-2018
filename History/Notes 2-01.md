### The Assault on Native American Tribalism: _The Dawes Severalty Act_

__I. Introduction: "Paved with Good Intentions"__
  + Intended to provide Native Americans with greater security
  + Strengthen legal protections for Native American land holdings

  + Native Americans did not want this law
    + Native Americans were not consulted
    + Passed by white politicians who regarded themselves as "Friends of the Indian"

  + Dawes act would divide up the reservations into land that would be divided among the Native Americans
    + The hope was that the Native Americans who recieved land this way would be better able to defend and hold onto this land
    + Some politicians felt that the Native Americans needed to become "more greedy"

  + Did not work out well for the Native Americans
    + Worked out well for white people who got surplus lands
    + Native Americans lose their reservations
      + Are forced into a capitalist society with very little to thier names
      + Reduced further into poverty and misery

__II. Brief Summary of The General Allotment Act of 1887 (Dawes Act)__
  + __5 Basic Provisions__

    + __1st Provision:__ Authorized the federal government to divide the reservations into smaller parcels which could be given to Native American families and individuals
      + A family could get 60 acres
      + An adult (over 18) could get 80 acres
      + A child (under 18) could get 40 acres

    + __2nd Provision:__ Native americans who recieve land under the act have stronger legal protections
      + Could go to court and sue for thier land

    + __3rd Provision:__ Federal government would hold these allotments in trust for 25 years
      + Can't sell the land

    + __4th Provision:__ All Native Americans who recieve land under The Dawes Act are enrolled as US citizens
      + Gives equal protection under the laws
      + Gives access to the courts

    + __5th Provision:__ All the land that's left over after the allotments have been made could be sold at public auction
      + Proceedes were supposed to go to the Native Americans, but most of them didn't

__III. The Need for "Reform"__

  + __A. Growing Pressure on Native American Lands__

    + Over time the reservation starts falling apart
      + Largely because the federal government did not do enough to protect that land
      + White people encroach on Native American lands and the government doesn't often side with the Native Americans.

    + Growing population as well as accelerating industry puts pressure on Native American lands
      + Ranchers
      + Farmers
      + Railroads
        + Government is happy to give the railroads as much land as they want
        + Land grants probably constitute the biggest act of corportate welfare in american history
      + Logging
      + Mining

    + __Homestead act of 1862:__
      + Government would give away 160 acres
      + Requirements:
        + Live there for five years
        + Improve it somehow

    + 1876: Fighting between US Army and Ute tribe
      + Utes live on silver rich land

    + Federal goverment is doing nothing to protect the reservations
      + This is the impetus behind the Dawes Act
      + "Friends of the Indians" feel that they need to do something

  + __B. Private Property: The Standard of "Civilization"__

    + White people thought that in every Native American was a white person longing to come out
      + "Kill the Indian, save the man."

    + Louis Henry Morgan - anthropologist
      + Human beings follow 3 stages in their social evolution
        + Stage 1: Savagery
          + Hunting and gathering
        + Stage 2: Barbarism
          + Agriculture
        + Stage 3: Civilization
          + _Private property_
      + If Native Americans can be turned into independent land owners they will sever their ties to the group and become greedy, and civilized
      + "In order for people to progress, they have to be free to pursue their own individual self interest"
      + "Selfishness is the cornerstone of modern civilization"

__IV. Results of The Dawes Act__

  + The amount of land owned by Native Americans goes down continually until 1934:
    + 1881: 155,632,312 acres
    + 1890: 104,314,349 acres
    + 1900:  77,865,373 acres

  + 1934: Reorganization Act
    + Dawes Act has failed
    + Allowed the Native Americans to piece together what land was left, back into reservations
    + The reservations that got reconstructed ended up being among the poorest places in the US
      + Largely due to public policy
